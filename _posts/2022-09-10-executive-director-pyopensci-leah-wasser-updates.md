## pyOpenSci is now an independent community organization

I am thrilled to announce that pyOpenSci is now a fiscally sponsored project of 
Community Initiatives! This means that pyOpenSci now serves the community of 
scientific python users and open source software maintainers. pyOpenSci is not 
affiliated with any specific organization. I (Leah) will now be devoting ALL of my 
(work :)) time to the pyOpenSci project full time as the official Executive Director. 

1. Packages that have gone through the review process.
2. Challenges that PyOpenSci is confronting in the open source Python community
3. Activities and events going on

## pyOpenSci’s current funding and structure

pyOpenSci is grateful for 2 years of funding from the Sloan Foundation to 
support this exciting effort. Once I seek and acquire additional funding, I 
will be able to hire more staff to grow the organization. I am working with a 
board of two right now: Tracy Teal (chair) and Karen Cranston. They both bring 
tremendous experience building and supporting The Carpentries, among other 
efforts; this board will guide me in propelling pyOpenSci forward. I also am 
working with two incredible editors that have been crucial in supporting peer 
review: David Nicholson and Ivan Ogasawara. In the upcoming months we will 
recruit more editors to support our open source software review process. 
Finally, I am also continuing to coordinate with and learn from the 
well-established and successful rOpenSci. rOpenSci has set the precedent for 
this type of organization in this space and I am grateful for their ongoing 
support. 


## pyOpenSci is not just peer review of open source software 
Peer review is critical but we aim to do more! We have several organization 
goals supported in the Sloan Foundation grant that we will be working on over 
the next few years:
* Creating and growing a diverse and supportive community around a dynamic and 
open peer review process: 
  * Through peer review we improve software quality and usability while enforcing community accepted standards for packaging.
  * Usability is an important part of our review process and as such we look for quality  documentation and educational “vignettes” that showcase tool functionality. 
  * Once accepted into our ecosystem, we will track tool maintenance and find new maintainers, or support sunsetting as need be
  * Through peer review we will also address redundancy in tool functionality across the ecosystem. Here domain specific partners will become critical.
* Create a model to support peer review within domain specific subcommunities. We intend to work with Pangeo and other communities to support a peer review process with community-specific standards applied on top of ours.   
* Provide training and mentorship in skills needed to contribute to open source. These skills are not just for open source. They are also fundamental to good open science practices and will support career trajectories in open science too. 
* Grow support for maintainers. A critical component of this effort will be a communication campaign around the importance of open source to science. 

## We will also continue to curate our partnership with the Journal of Open 
Source Software (JOSS). Package maintainers can still submit a package to us 
and once accepted, if the package fits into the JOSS scope it can be fast 
tracked and accepted via our peer review into JOSS as well. 

## Who do we serve?
pyOpenSci supports maintainers of smaller scientific python open source projects. 
We also support scientists using these tools and will empower folks like you 
with the skills needed to both contribute to Open Source and improve your open 
science workflows! In the long term these skills will be invaluable in your 
data intensive career trajectory!

## pyOpenSci is about collaboration - not reinventing the wheel
Collaborations with existing efforts are critical. I welcome any feedback from 
you regarding groups that we should be engaging with! I will also need help 
finding reviewers and editors, mentors to support training efforts and voices to 
spread the word about the project. 

## And… what's the timeline?
Unless I figure out how to create robot clones of myself, please know that all 
of the above won’t happen immediately. I am currently the sole employee of the 
organization and this is my second week. 

## Stay in touch!
There are many ways to stay in touch with our project. Once I have a road map 
for activities developed, I will communicate this here on our 
[website](https://www.pyopensci.org/),  Twitter 
and discourse. So be sure to follow [@pyOpenSci on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/pyopensci). 
In the meantime, our open peer review process will continue to 
operate. We welcome new submissions for packages that are in scope to be 
reviewed. Please reach out to me at any time with questions, comments or ideas 
for the organization as it grows. I welcome any help, ideas or support as we 
move forward. 

## What can you do now?
There are a few ways to get involved with us now.

1. [You can sign up to be a reviewer by filling out our reviewer form]
(https://forms.gle/B6zAukLCvJot5nws6). If you do this, we will reach out to you if a package is submitted that suits your background and interests!
1. If you have a package that you are working on, [you can submit it to our peer review process](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues). 
  * You can learn more about our review process here in our [community guide (which will be updated in the upcoming months so that it is more clear)](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/open-source-software-peer-review/aims-and-scope.html).
  * If you have a package that you wish to submit but need some guidance, you can also submit a presubmission inquiry or a request for help here.
2. You can [follow us on twitter](https://www.twitter.com/pyopensci) to keep tabs on our progress. 
 
I am so excited to be leading this effort and look forward to keeping in touch 
with everyone and supporting the community as pyOpenSci grows. 

More to come... soon…
